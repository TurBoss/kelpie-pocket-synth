### About

The KELPIE is a portable monophonic & polyphonic digital synth with a hardware interface inspired by the Moog Sirin. The device consists of 16 knobs and 4 LED buttons, a standard MIDI input, 1/4" mono output, 1/8" stereo output, and a micro-USB input (for programming). The goal of this project was to create a budget digital synthesizer for all experience levels that could be easily interfaced with a MIDI keyboard and used in live performances. This is a "no-frills" synthesizer, with no presets, arpeggiator, or storage. This was also an exercise in designing a "product" from scratch, including electronics, industrial design, mechanical engineering, prototyping, and software.

_7/13/19: still a work in progress, I'm hoping to finish in time to submit to the [Hackaday Prize 2019](https://hackaday.com/2019/04/03/2019-hackaday-prize-begins-right-now/) . In the meantime, follow my progress [here](https://hackaday.io/project/166460-kelpie-synth-module-for-keyboard-controllers)_
